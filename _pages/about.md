I am a **Incoming Assistant Professor** in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.nycu.edu.tw/) at [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index).
I received my PhD degree in [Computer Science and Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ncku.edu.tw/en/) from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in 2025, advised by [Prof. Kun-Ta Chuang](https://researchoutput.ncku.edu.tw/en/persons/kun-ta-chuang) in the [NetDB Lab](https://netdb.csie.ncku.edu.tw/).


Research Interests
======

My research focuses on **Data Mining**, **Reinforcement Learning**,, **Knowledge Graph Embedding/Reasoning**, **Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**, and **Time Series Analysis**. I have collaborated with organizations across healthcare, smart energy, integrated circuits, education, etc. More detailscan be found in my [CV](https://LPYTing.github.io/files/lpyting_CV.pdf).
